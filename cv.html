      I'm a self-taught developer living and working in San Diego, California.
      I mostly work with front-end technologies, but I'm also very passionate
      about functional programming and co-organize the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Functional-Programmers/">San Diego Functional Programmers</a>
      meetup group. When I get the chance, I like to make it out to different local meetups and <a href="talks.html">speak</a>
      about all things functional.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about learning, and I'm always looking for a new challenge.

          <p>Developer responsible for maintenance of legacy applications primarily used by internal customers (insurance agents, etc.). The technology stack was wide-ranging, though
            all Microsoft technology. It included ASP.NET, Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation, and MS SQL. I had a hand in maintaining all parts of the applications our team
            was responsible for, from the front-end (whether it be HTML/JS/CSS or Windows controls) all the way down to the database (including SPROCs). Toward the end of my tenure with this team,
            I was tasked with creating a new web application which I designed and implemented using ASP.NET MVC on the backend and KnockoutJS on the frontend. The application allowed users to
          reconcile client records by providing a diff of the data and allowing the user to pick which data elements were correct.</p>

          <p>Engineer on a team responsible for the company's intranet. My duties included customizing SharePoint pages with CSS and JS,
            creating custom lists and workflows, SharePoint administration, and custom C# app development (primarily to automate tasks). I'm most proud of a tool I created using an OSS library
            that indexed all of the sites in our farm, compiled metadata about the each site, and dynamically displayed the data for each site a user visited; allowing them to see when it was
            updated, which organization owned the site, and the users responsible for content. I'm especially proud of my work to get the running time of the job from 9 hours to 15 minutes;
            unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to share my improvements with the creators of the library we used.</p>
          <p>I also had an opportunity to build an internal DSL for configuring a workflow that converted documents from one format to another (can't recall which). It was a good yak shave
            and proved to be a very extensible solution</p>
